# Spatial-Sound-Transformation-toolkit-for-Max
The Spatial Sound Transformation toolkit for Max is a collection of Max modules in the form of bpatchers build around IRCAMÂ´s Spat5 library and has been developed throughout my own artistic practice but also through lectures and workshops I have given in artistic and creative use of ambisonic over the past years.
